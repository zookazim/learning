# Azure Stream Analytics

Azure Stream Analytics is a fully managed stream processing engine that is designed to analyze and process large volumes of streaming data with sub-millisecond latencies. You can build a streaming data pipeline using Stream Analytics to identity patterns and relationships in data that originates from various input sources including applications, devices, sensors, clickstreams, and social media feeds. Then, you can use these patterns to trigger actions and initiate workflows such as raising alerts, feeding information to a reporting tool, or storing transformed data for later use. Stream Analytics is also available on the Azure IoT Edge runtime, which enables you to process data directly from IoT devices.
