# Python Environments Notes

## Setup

``` bash


```

## Create environment


``` bash
mkdir environments
python3 -m venv my_env
```


## Use environments

source my_env/bin/activate
```

## Remove environment

Simple! Just remove the directory :-)

Use deactivate if it's been previously activated

``` bash
deactivate
rm -r my_env
```
